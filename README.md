WeatherSports finds a location anywhere around the world, provided either by user entry or approved geolocation. Retrieves current weather data and compares it against a database of sports/outdoor activities. The user is then given a list of viable activities and directed towards events (only for the US at the moment) & resources for whatever activity is chosen.
